## Buggy behaviour

**Intended outcome:**
Data returned from a @client resolver should be written into the cache rather than merged with previous results.

Specifically, I'm returning an array of strings. 

**Actual outcome:**
The last item of the array will start to get duplicated when the resolver returns less items. For example, on the initial resolver run, returns full array:

* `return ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] // return value of resolver`
* value saved to cache: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`

Next run, item `'c'` is omitted

* `return ['a', 'b', 'd']`
* value saved to cache: `['a', 'b', 'd', 'd']`

Next run, item `'b'` is omitted

* `return ['a', 'd']`
* value saved to cache: `['a', 'd', 'd', 'd']`
